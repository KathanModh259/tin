# Scoring and sequencing

Run this block exactly as written. Save the verified course records from Station 3 as a JSON
list, then call `plan(courses, as_of, max_courses, searches, opened)` and use its result for
the report. The ranking lives here so that two runs on the same evidence give the same plan.

The timing window is an assumption, kept in two constants: instructors settle next term's
tools between about four months and three weeks before it starts (bookstore adoption and
syllabus deadlines usually fall in that span). Courses are assumed to run once a year unless
the page gives a later start date; for courses that run every term, enter the next start.
A document dated more than two years before `as_of` is not evidence of a current course,
and a course only seen in a search snippet is not evidence of anything yet, including that
it already uses the product. The verdict is `fit` only when at least three courses make the
shortlist; one or two hands-on courses are `thin`.
